 gcg_nuclearstartup.1.d:0 "Hey there, First off thank you for downloading my mod! \n\n The Radiation Kills mod is a mod that adds radiation to the game and allowing you the player to create a nuclear apocalypse if you are not carefull enough with your nukes. And in case youre bored you can also just trigger an apocalypse but this can only be done the first week after start!"

 gcg_nuclearstartup.2.d:0 "Mechanics:\n The way the mod works is once a nuclear bomb is dropped it will cause population damage to said state and add radiation, higher levels of radiation will eventually start killing the states population, on top of this there is a overall level of radiation in the top bar ( if you're using mods that put aditional graphics in the top bar it might not be visible). \nThe overall radiation will cause debuffs for every country, debuffs start at 10 mSv and are at max when above 100, the debuffs include but are not limited to:\nLower population growth, lower factory output, smaller number of healthy workers causing less building slots and divisions always attritioning.\n\nCleaning:\n Radiation can be removed, doing so also slightly lowers the global radiation levels however it is a slow and expensive process to undertake."

 gcg_nuclearstartup.3.d:0 "Attrition: \nTo simulate units dying from radiation I enabled unit upkeep, this means units are technically speaking always attritioning, it is however set to such a low level that if there is no radiation there wont be attrition, when the global radiation rises the upkeep of units will increase till eventually becomming unmanagable.\n\nNBC Unit:\nThe NBC unit is a unit that without radiation does absolutely nothing, this unit consumes support equipment and will only have functionality once radiation levels start rising, It will lower the ammount of attrition the units take from radiation however it can only cover 14 units at low levels of radiation, it becomes an increasingly difficult task for the unit the higher the radiation is."
