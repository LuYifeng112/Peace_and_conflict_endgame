This Mod is about from 2020 and into the future but what is the catch? The upcoming third world war! With big ambition to research and create accurate predictions of politics and national decisions this mod is made to reflect on the threat of fading democracy in some areas of the world and the consequences of it. 
For example:
[*] Taiwan PRC negotiations 
[*] Korean ultimatum 
[*] European populism 
[*] Russian military ambitions 
[*] Japan-US dynamic shift 
[*] Brexit
[*] Brazil's Right wing leader
[*] Results of the Indian election 
[*] Indo-Pakistani conflict 
and many more!
 and bring light to a new modern mod with a lot of creativity to change the path of the future. As of now you have the power to change the future! With no determined end date of this mod we will develop endless possibilities!
