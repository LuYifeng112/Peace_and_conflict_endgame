# Millennium Dawn Scripts


Created by the Millenium Dawn Dev team

These are a list of python3 scripts developed by the Hearts Of Iron 4: Millenium Dawn team. These scripts may not be up to date as we keep the latest version in our main mod repo, contact us on our discord for the latest version.

Requirments: Python3.7

1) Create a folder in your mod called tools, place the script in it.
2) Run the script


# ALWAYS MAKE BACKUPS BEFORE RUNNING THESE SCRIPTS, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

# convert naval oobs 1.6.py

Will remove naval OOB's from your existing OOB's and convert them into the new 1.6 format. A folder will be created in history/units called generated that will contain the new naval OOB's.

# who doesnt have airbases.py

Checks who doesn't have an airbase.


# check oob errors.py

Checks your oobs for errors that paradox's validator doesn't detect, ignores or doesn't explain well enough thus making fixing error a pain.


# check_ids.py

Checks for duplicate event ID's

# generate_leader_IDs.py

Will edit your history/country files and give every leader an ID. If you're not using git, make a backup before using as it edits your history files.

# Check_basic_style, check_basic_style2, coding_standards & fix_styling.py are wip

We use these scripts to check for common errors like spacing, missing brackets, to check that events have logging and other common errors. Fix_styling.py will automatically fix some of these errors for you, use at your own risk, make backups.
