 POLITICS_ASHRAD_GHANI_DESC:0 "From 1974 to 1977 Ghani taught anthropology at Kabul University. He left Afghanistan again in 1977 to study anthropology in the United States; a communist coup in 1978 prevented him from returning home. After Ghani earned (1983) a Ph.D. in anthropology from Columbia University, New York City, he taught at the University of California, Berkeley (1983), and Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Md. (1983–91). He joined the World Bank in 1991 and spent the following decade focusing on the design and reform of state institutions in less-developed countries.After the downfall of the Taliban regime in 2001, Ghani returned to Afghanistan and served as an adviser to Lakhdar Brahimi, the UN secretary-general’s special envoy to Afghanistan. In that capacity Ghani was closely involved with the formulation of the Bonn Agreement, which outlined the transition to an elected government. He also served as an adviser to interim president Karzai and as minister of finance (2002–04), overseeing the successful introduction of a new Afghan currency.In 2009 Ghani ran for president, presenting himself as a modern technocratic alternative to the incumbent Karzai. Ghani’s campaign, however, never found a base of support outside Kabul, and he came in fourth in the first round of voting, with less than 3% of the vote.Ghani is pro-modernist and a fond admirer of former Afghanistan's progressive King Amanullah Khan and President Mohammed Daoud Khan."
